| Analysis on Standardised Test (SAT & ACT) | July 2021 | As part of JustHangOn Consulting Group, we have been tasked by US Education department(fictional Audience) to provide recommendation on how might we be able to increase the SAT /ACT participate rate and score , so that the US education ranking system remain competitive and relevant globally.We will be studying the trends into the effect of individual key category in, and will provide key insights base on the following key category :<br>* States<br>* Races<br>* College Major<br>* Household Income and State Income<br>* Fee Waiver and Grant | In-depth EDA analysis | SAT and ACT Score 2018 , 2019 |

Like many of his peers in the working profession archetype, he is at a crossroad where he is looking to sell off his current house, so that he have sufficient capital to relocate to a bigger house to establish his new and impending growing family.<br><br>Complication<br><br>Facing the financial challenge from their upcoming major life events (weddings , kids , new house, etc) , they often troubled over ways to optimise the selling price of their current house so as to lessen the financial burden arising from these events.<br><br>Question (Problem Statement)<br>As a specialist in an established property and interior design team in Millennium Walk, how might we be able to use our housing prediction models to provide advise to house seller on which features to improve within their renovation spending budget , so that they are able to optimise their selling price between 5% to 10% from their current baseline Sale Price. | Regression Modelling<br>- Linear Regression<br>- Lasso,<br>- Ridge,<br>- Elastic Net,<br>- Random Foresat Regressor | AMES Housing Dataset |
| [Natural Language Processing on Subreddit Post](https://github.com/86lekwenshiung/GA-Data-Science-Immersive-Projects/blob/main/Natural_Language_Processing_with_Reddit_Post.ipynb) | Sep 2021 | With the overflowing of information in the current world , we often find it hard to discern between what is real and fake , what is true and false and what is the full story and selective story. Often , we will find rouge players using misleading words to mix into sentences to arouse sentiments or misinformed the public so that the desired reactions could be derived from their victims. Are we able to experiment various modelling and processing technique, so that we are able to create well performed text processing model to help the enmass to better differentiate between fake news and real news?  | Natural Language Processing<br>- Count Vectorizer , TFIDF Transformer<br>- Bi-direction LSTM<br>- Neural Network<br>- Word Embedding <br>- Transfer Learning (Universal Sentence Encoder) | Subreddit : r/fakenews<br>Subreddit : r/worldnews |

It is a member of the family Flaviviridae, from the genus Flavivirus, which also contains the Zika virus, dengue virus, and yellow fever virus. The virus is primarily transmitted by mosquitoes, mostly species of Culex. It has been causing significant and sometimes severe human diseases. Although pesticides are known to be effective in dealing with the virus-carrying mosquitoes, it is expensive to deploy pesticides throughout the city.As data scientists, we want to understand the factors driving the spread of WNV by leveraging on data collected by Chicago's surveillance system, weather stations, and pesticide spray deployment, in order to develop a classfication model that could predict the presence of WNV within the area of the city. Through these studies, we hope to suggest a cost-efficient and effective method of deploying pesticides within the area.|XGBoost , Random Forest|West Nile Virus DataSet|
